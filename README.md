üçÉFarmAI

Using the potential of machine learning and deep learning in the agriculture industry.
üöÄInspiration

Farming in India is deeply ingrained in its cultural and economic fabric, with a significant portion of the population engaged in agriculture. The country‚Äôs diverse agro-climatic zones allow for the cultivation of a wide variety of crops, ranging from rice and wheat to spices and fruits. Traditional farming practices coexist with modern agricultural techniques, reflecting the rich agricultural heritage.

FarmAI is a web application in which we employed advanced machine learning and deep learning technologies to assist you in navigating the entire farming process. Empower yourself to make well-informed decisions by delving into local demographics, gaining insights into factors influencing crops, and implementing strategies to ensure robust crop health, ultimately leading to increased yields.

Implementing predictive analytics can assist in anticipating and mitigating the impact of pests, diseases, and adverse weather conditions. Precision agriculture techniques, powered by machine learning algorithms, can tailor farming practices to specific microenvironments, optimizing water and fertilizer usage.

ü§ñWhat it does

Our FarmAI app leverages machine learning and deep learning technologies which hold immense potential for transforming India‚Äôs agricultural sector. These advanced technologies can be instrumental in optimizing resource allocation, crop management, and decision-making processes. By analyzing vast datasets, it provides valuable insights into crop recommendation, fertilizer suggestion based on soil conditions, and weather-based crop disease alerts ‚Äî enabling farmers to make informed choices for improved yield and resource efficiency.

üí°Key features

1Ô∏è‚É£ Crop Recommendation System

Make informed decisions about crop selection by leveraging our advanced recommendation system. FarmAI analyzes local conditions, real-time weather data (temperature and humidity via Weather API), and soil characteristics (N-P-K values) to suggest the most suitable crops for cultivation. By combining weather and soil nutrient data, this feature aims to maximize yields and promote sustainable farming practices.

The N-P-K (Nitrogen - Phosphorous - Potassium) values to be entered should be in proper ratio. Refer the website for more information.

While entering the city name, make sure to enter common cities. Remote cities/towns may not be available in the Weather API from where data like temperature and humidity is fetched.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Fertilizer Recommendation

Enhance soil fertility and crop health with our intelligent soil-fertilizer recommendation system. FarmAI assesses the specific soil composition, providing personalized suggestions for the best-suited fertilizers. Simultaneously, it recommends compatible crops, ensuring optimal nutrient utilization and promoting efficient farming practices.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Crop Disease Alert and Weather-based Management

Stay ahead of crop diseases with real-time weather-based alerts. FarmAI uses Weather API data like temperature and humidity to predict potential diseases that could affect your crops due to changing environmental conditions. It also offers preventive solutions and management suggestions to reduce risk and ensure healthy crop growth.

Supported crops - Apple, Blueberry, Cherry, Corn, Grape, Pepper, Orange, Peach, Potato, Soybean, Strawberry, Tomato, Squash, Raspberry
